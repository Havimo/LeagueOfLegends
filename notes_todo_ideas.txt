Notes & recent discovery :

- PCA shows that dmg dealt, dmg taken and gold are the most important variables to look out for, kills and death not so much. This is for the non normliazed by duration dataset.
- when normalizing by duration, results vary a bit but the general idea of dmg being prevalent is stil true


Some ideas / todos :
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

1 - test whether or not jungle forgetting to take Smite has a big impact on the win rate 

2 - improve the models with calculated variables, such as dividing by duration where it makes sense. Create categorical where appropriate

3 - run subset & feature selection

4 - decide on which variables we want to do explaining 

5 - uniformize the datasets which we are using (normalized, duration normalized etc. )

6 - Find third variable explaining the plot of Adrien
